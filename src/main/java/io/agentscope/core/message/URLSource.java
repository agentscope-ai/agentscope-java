 * Represents URL-based media content.

 * <p>This source references media files accessible via URLs, supporting
 * both remote HTTP/HTTPS URLs and local file URLs. This approach is
 * preferred when media files are hosted externally or when file size
 * makes Base64 encoding impractical.
 *
 * <p>Supported URL formats:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Remote URLs: https://example.com/image.jpg</li>
 *   <li>Local files: file:///absolute/path/to/file.jpg</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Using URL sources is more efficient for large media files and allows
 * the system to stream content rather than loading everything into memory.
